# Angular testing examples

A repository that illustrates two more approaches to testing Angular using WDIO.

1. Using component tests [harness](/harness), more details - https://github.com/Badisi/wdio-harness 
2. Using [WDIO browser runner](WDIO browser runner) + [Vite](/vite), I managed to run the Angular application on Vite, but not the tests themselves, I think an experienced Angular developer is needed to solve this problem )
